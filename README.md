- 👋 Hi, I’m @lunrnightngale
- 👀 I’m not interested in coding a website, but I am being forced by my teammates.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to procrastinate and copy code for the website in a productive way.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with my teammates, but only one of them would probably be able to help and they're the one forcing me to do this.
- 📫 How to reach me? Be one of my teammates. Then you can definitely reach me.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I really do not want to do anything for this project esp not 4-5 months early, but it's best to be prepared, so I am.
